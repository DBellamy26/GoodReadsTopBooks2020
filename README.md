# GoodReadsTopBooks2020
Allows the user to select a category to obtain the Top 20 books for 2020.

Thank you for looking at my beginner Python project. The overall goal of this was to learn
about webscraping and organizing the data using Pandas. 

The idea of this came from my curiosity of the different general genres of books that are
available. I wanted to learn what the top books are based on these genres. Fortunately,
GoodReads (www.goodreads.com), provides lists of books that feature these top books.

How the program works:
1) It'll list the 20 categories that are voted on
2) User choses the category he/she is interested in by entering an integer (1 through 20)
3) The program provides a table output with the Top 20 books via GoodReads

Simple and was fun to make the breakthroughs where it actually started working. I understand
there are going to be large inefficiencies, but that's part of the learning process.

I look forward to gaining experience and creating more user-friendly fun!
